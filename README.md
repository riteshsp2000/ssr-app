# ssr-app
An extremely basic server-side-rendered app which includes all the major functioning required by a web-app.
This app does not include any framework such as next.js or gatsby.js. It is a barebone setup. You can use this as a template to setup your ssr project.

# Starting the project on your local machine
1. install node.js
2. change into the project directory.
3. run the command ``` npm install ```
4. to start the server, run ``` npm run dev ```
